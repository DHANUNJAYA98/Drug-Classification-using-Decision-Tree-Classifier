# Drug-Classification-using-Decision-Tree-Classifier
Accurate classification of drugs is essential in the medical field for various purposes such as identifying the appropriate treatment, understanding drug interactions, and predicting drug efficacy.
- Data Preprocessing: The project includes thorough data preprocessing steps to clean and transform the raw drug dataset. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training and evaluation.

- Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected from the drug dataset to capture the important characteristics of each drug. Feature selection techniques may involve statistical analysis, correlation analysis, or domain-specific knowledge.

- Decision Tree Classifier: The Decision Tree Classifier algorithm is implemented to classify the drugs. The algorithm creates a decision tree based on the selected features and their relationships to predict the class of a given drug.

- Model Evaluation: The performance of the Decision Tree Classifier model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to assess the model's generalization capabilities.

- Visualization: The project utilizes data visualization techniques to provide insights into the drug classification results, decision boundaries of the decision tree model, or other visually informative representations.
